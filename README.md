## Project Description

MentorIA+ is an artificial intelligence solution designed to enhance the work of career coaches by providing an interactive and inclusive support system to facilitate the training and professional development of people with disabilities or barriers to employment. Through an intuitive and accessible conversational interface, MentorIA+ allows coaches to create personalized learning paths, automate routine consultations, and offer motivational assistance.

For employees, MentorIA+ provides an accessible learning experience with voice interaction, high contrast, and adaptability to different needs. Additionally, the system allows for progress assessment through questionnaires and the generation of detailed reports to optimize the learning curve. This not only improves the efficiency of on-the-job training but also ensures ongoing support that reinforces inclusion and equity in employment.

## Key Objectives

1. **Provide accessibility and inclusion in the learning process**: Design a conversational interface with voice support and high contrast, adapted to people with visual impairments.
   
2. **Automate and personalize training**: Generate personalized learning paths from content provided by job coaches.

3. **Monitor and improve the learning process**: Evaluate employees' learning curve through questionnaires and detailed reports for trainers.

## Features

- **Learning Curve Monitoring**: Helps trainers assess each employee's progress and adapt content based on their level of knowledge.
- **Automated consultations and motivational support**: Reduces the administrative burden on job coaches by answering frequently asked questions and providing immediate feedback.
- **Digital Accessibility and Inclusion**: Provides voice interaction and high-contrast design for people with visual impairments, promoting equity in access to knowledge.

## Architecture The C4 model for visualising software architecture

This document describes the architecture of software systems, based on communication.
efficiently and effectively the software architecture, at different levels of detail,
telling different stories to different types of audiences, This will be refined as
Architectural decisions mature and the project moves forward.

### System context diagram

A System Context diagram is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with.

### Container diagram

The Container diagram shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another. Itâ€™s a simple, high-level technology focussed diagram that is useful for software developers and support/operations staff alike.

    <td>
		The agent generates questions related to the topic the user is studying, helping to reinforce their understanding and promoting interactivity during the learning process.
		<br>- estado_inicial: Sends the initial state to the next node to continue the process flow.		
		<br>- genera_question: Generates questions in JSON format related to a specific topic, based on its content.		
		<br>- save_question: Saves the generated questions in Cosmos DB for later access and analysis.

	<td>Topic agent</td>
	<td>
		The agent generates content related to the topic it is studying, tailoring the information accurately and relevantly to support the learning process.
		<br>- start: First, it checks whether a conversation with the user has already been initiated or if this is their first time accessing the topic. If it's the first time, it starts the process from scratch.		
		<br>- initialize: The agent queries the topic the user will study, providing relevant information about the topic to introduce the user to the content.		
		<br>- chatbot: The user starts interacting with the content of the topic they are studying, asking questions or receiving detailed explanations as needed.
